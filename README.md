# AI Engineering Newsletter

This workspace contains an auditable daily AI Engineering Newsletter pipeline. It refreshes Chinese markdown newsletters and a mobile-readable static HTML archive every morning at 08:00.

## What It Produces

- Top 10 English-language General AI News items covering model releases, AI products, company dynamics, open-source models, policy, funding, and major research progress.
- Top 5 English-language Engineering AI News items from a rolling window, covering engineering, simulation, CAD, CAE, SPDM, PLM, digital twins, physical AI, scientific ML, and industrial AI.
- Optional Research Radar and Watchlist Updates sections.
- A candidate audit file with up to 100 scored news candidates from the enabled curated source registry.
- A run log with source failures and ranking reasons.

## Why It Is Not a Black Box

The daily newsletter is based on explicit configuration:

- Source registry: `config/sources.yaml`
- Legacy source config fallback: `config/sources.json`
- Topic filters: `config/keywords.json`
- Candidate builder: `scripts/build_digest_candidates.py`
- Daily artifacts: `data/digests/`

Each candidate records source, link, matched terms, visible engagement signals, total score, score reasons, and sub-scores:

- `general_ai_score`
- `engineering_relevance_score`
- `research_relevance_score`
- `novelty_score`
- `source_priority_score`

Direct read counts are often not public, so the ranking estimates reach using visible evidence such as source priority, engagement, recency, topic relevance, and cross-source evidence. The source registry is intentionally extensible; the daily candidate pool, not the source count, is capped at 100.

Selection is not a raw popularity leaderboard. After duplicate-event removal, the Top 10 General AI list and Top 5 Engineering AI list apply topic diversification so one hot area, such as AI payments, regulation, data centers, or model-release drama, does not crowd out the whole newsletter. The default cap is two items per broad topic before the selector relaxes the cap to fill empty slots.

## Source Registry

`config/sources.yaml` is the curated source registry. It is the default source configuration, but it is not a closed list. Add, disable, edit, or reprioritize sources there without changing code.

Each source contains at least:

```yaml
name: OpenAI
url: https://openai.com/news/rss.xml
source_type: rss
category: vendor
priority: high
tags: [frontier_model, product, api]
notes: Official OpenAI news.
enabled: true
```

Supported `source_type` values include `rss`, `website`, `github`, `arxiv`, `linkedin_manual`, `x_api`, `newsletter`, and `manual`. Sources with a stable RSS/API can also set `fetch_type`; sources without stable public access are kept as watchlist/manual review entries. The project does not scrape logged-in feeds or fragile pages.

## Run Manually

Create a local virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create your private environment file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then edit `.env` and replace `OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here` with your real key. Keep `.env` private; it is ignored by git.

Recommended first-run budget settings:

```text
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4.1-mini
OPENAI_CLASSIFIER_MODEL=gpt-5-nano
OPENAI_DAILY_MAX_TOKENS=120000
OPENAI_MONTHLY_BUDGET_USD=5
```

Build the candidate audit:

```bash
python3 scripts/build_digest_candidates.py --window-hours 24
```

Outputs:

```text
data/digests/YYYY-MM-DD-candidates.json
data/digests/YYYY-MM-DD-briefing-input.md
```

The briefing input uses this structure:

```text
# AI Engineering Newsletter - YYYY-MM-DD

## Top 10 General AI News

## Top 5 Engineering AI News

## Research Radar

## Watchlist Updates

## Why It Matters
```

## Rolling Page

The rolling page is generated at:

```text
site/index.html
```

Regenerate it manually after new newsletter files are created:

```bash
python3 scripts/render_digest_site.py
```

The newest newsletter appears at the top. If `data/digests/YYYY-MM-DD-final.md` exists, the page shows the final Chinese newsletter for that date; otherwise it shows the candidate audit cards.

## Mobile Web Publishing

The `site/` directory is a static website and can be published with GitHub Pages. This repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow that deploys `site/` whenever the `main` branch is pushed.

After the first push, enable Pages in GitHub if needed:

```text
Repository Settings -> Pages -> Source: GitHub Actions
```

The daily automation refreshes `data/digests/YYYY-MM-DD-final.md` and rebuilds `site/index.html`. Push the updated files to GitHub to refresh the phone-accessible page:

```text
https://tiktaalika.github.io/ai-engineering-newsletter/
```

## LinkedIn Handling

LinkedIn is useful for CAE and AI-for-engineering practice notes, but its logged-in feed is not a stable public API. This project treats LinkedIn as a public search source and records it transparently. If a source cannot be fetched, the failure appears in the run log instead of being silently ignored.

Google News RSS queries are used as automatic supplemental recall for broad AI and Engineering AI topics. LinkedIn public searches are kept as supplemental search tasks so placeholder search URLs are not mistaken for ranked news items.

For a stronger LinkedIn implementation, add one of these later:

- A compliant LinkedIn API integration if you have access.
- A manually curated list of public LinkedIn author/company URLs.
- A browser-assisted review step for logged-in reading, with explicit human approval.

## Daily Newsletter Format

For each selected item, the automation should output:

1. One-sentence Chinese headline-style summary.
2. Five-sentence Chinese summary.
3. Original English link.
4. Chinese translation of the key original content.
